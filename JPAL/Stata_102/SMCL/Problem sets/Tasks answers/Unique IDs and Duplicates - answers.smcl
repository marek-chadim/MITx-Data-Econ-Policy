{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 1}

{hline}

{pstd}{it}{...} Can you name a few reasons why a unique ID is important?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}Some of the tasks for which a unique ID is important:{break}
- Matching respondents across rounds (for example, matching baseline and endline
observations) and across datasets (for example, survey data and administrative
data){break}
- Data entry reconciliation{break}
- Analyzing data, when personally identifiable information (PII) must be
separated from the rest of the data{break}
- Publishing data, when PII must be stripped from the dataset

{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 2}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{it}{...} Which values of {cmd:hhid} does {cmd:duplicates drop} resolve?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"duplicates list hhid"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{bf:{stata `"duplicates drop"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{bf:{stata `"duplicates list hhid"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}This reveals that only {cmd:hhid "1807077"} was resolved.

{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 3}

{hline}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{it}{...} {bf:(a)}

{pstd}{it}{...} Does the variable {cmd:surveyid} uniquely identify observations?
{it}{...} If not, which values are duplicated?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"isid surveyid"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}We see that {cmd:surveyid} does not uniquely identify the observations.

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"duplicates list surveyid"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}There are two observations with {cmd:surveyid 981}.

{pstd}{it}{...} {bf:(b)}

{pstd}{it}{...} Drop observations that are duplicates on all variables.
{it}{...} Does this change your answer to the previous question?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"duplicates drop"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"isid surveyid"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{bf:{stata `"duplicates list surveyid"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}The observations with {cmd:surveyid 981} were identical across all variables.
Thus, following the use of {cmd:duplicates drop},
{cmd:surveyid} is now a unique identifier.
