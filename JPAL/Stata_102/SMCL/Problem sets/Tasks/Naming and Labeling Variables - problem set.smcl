{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Consider the problem of renaming the same variables
multiple times with different prefixes.
First, assign the prefix {cmd:base_} (for "baseline") to all variables.
Then rename variables with the prefix {cmd:mid_} instead.
Finally, rename with the prefix {cmd:end_}.

{pstd}What variable(s) would you not want to rename in this fashion?

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}In this dataset, a number of variables end with {cmd:_1} or {cmd:_2}.
But imagine you instead prefer these variables
to begin with {cmd:first_} and {cmd:second_}, respectively.
How would you go about doing this?

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Variables {cmd:robberyyn}, {cmd:assaultyn} and {cmd:falsecaseyn}
share the same value label, which has been removed for this problem set.
In one line of code,
label the values of all three variables with the existing value label {cmd:yesno}.

{pstd}{bf:Problem Set Question 4}

{hline}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}For the variable {cmd:educ},
why are some values labeled while others are apparently not?
You can see this as follows:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"tabulate educ"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:Hint:} begin by determining the value label using {cmd:describe}.

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}When you create a new variable,
you often want to immediately assign it a value label.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(a)}

{pstd}First create a new variable named {cmd:over40}
that equals {cmd:1} if {cmd:age} is greater than {cmd:40},
and {cmd:0} if it is not.

{pstd}How would you go about checking that you have created the variable correctly?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(b)}

{pstd}Assign an appropriate value label to {cmd:over40}.

{pstd}{bf:Hint:} use {cmd:label list} to see
which existing value label would be appropriate
for the new variable you've created.

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}First, execute the following commands,
which define the value label {cmd:addressunit}
and assign it to the variable {cmd:addressdur_unit}:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"label define addressunit 1 days 2 weeks 3 months 4 years"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{bf:{stata `"label values addressdur_unit addressunit"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(a)}

{pstd}Combining the two variables {cmd:addressdur} and {cmd:addressdur_unit},
create a new variable named {cmd:addressdays} that indicates
the number of days a respondent has lived at his/her current address.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(b)}

{pstd}Calculate the mean number of days
that respondents have lived at their current address.
