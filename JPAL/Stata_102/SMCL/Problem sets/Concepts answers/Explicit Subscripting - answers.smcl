{pstd}{it}{...} Why does sort order matter when using explicit subscripting?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}The explicit subscript {it:varname}{cmd:[}{it:obs_num}{cmd:]}
is the value of variable {it:varname} in observation number {it:obs_num}.
Explicit subscripting allows you to refer to a variable's value
in a particular observation number.
However, the association between observations and their observation numbers isn't fixed:
an observation can have any observation number
between {cmd:1} and the number of observations.
The order of the observations {hline 2}
the correspondence of observations and their observation numbers {hline 2}
depends on the sort order.

{pstd}This means that when using explicit subscripting,
you have to be careful that the sort order is the way you expect.
If the sort order changes {hline 2}
if the list of variables by which the data is sorted is changed or
if any of those variables are modified {hline 2}
then the same observation number may refer to a different observation.
This can lead to difficult-to-detect bugs,
so solutions that don't rely on sort order and explicit subscripting
are often preferable.

{pstd}{it}{...} Using explicit subscripting,
write a for-loop that displays the fifth and sixth values of the following variables:
{cmd:age}, {bf:educ}, and {bf:castename}.
Ensure that the data is sorted by {bf:hhid} beforehand.

{pstd}Use the {cmd:browse} command to check your answer.

{pstd}If you need a refresher on for-loops, visit the module on
{view `""SMCL/Concepts/Loops.smcl""':for-loops and macros}.
