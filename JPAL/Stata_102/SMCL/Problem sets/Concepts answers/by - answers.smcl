{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 1}

{hline}

{pstd}{it}{...} What are by-groups and by-variables?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}By-groups are subsets of the data used by the {cmd:by} prefix.
Every observation in the dataset belongs to exactly one by-group.
When used with {cmd:by}, a command is executed separately for each by-group.
The by-variables are the list of variables that follow {cmd:by}.
Each combination of values of the by-variables is
associated with an individual by-group.
The by-variables are constant within a given by-group;
all observations of a particular by-group share the same values of the by-variables.

{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 2}

{hline}

{pstd}{it}{...} What is the {cmd:bysort} command?
{it}{...} How does it differ from {cmd:by}?
{it}{...} When should you use {cmd:bysort}?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{cmd:bysort} combines the {cmd:by} and {cmd:sort} commands.
It first sorts the dataset by the by-variables
and then executes the {cmd:by} command.
By itself, {cmd:by} requires that the dataset be previously sorted.

{pstd}{cmd:bysort} should be used
when the dataset hasn't already been sorted by the by-variables.
However, it's always possible to use {cmd:bysort} instead of {cmd:by}:
there's no harm in using {cmd:bysort} over {cmd:by}.

{pstd}Note you cannot combine {cmd:by} with {cmd:gsort} if you want to
have by-variables in descending order. Use {cmd:gsort} first and then
execute {cmd:by}.

{hline}{marker q3}

{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 3}

{hline}

{pstd}{it}{...} We know that without {cmd:by},
{BIGN...} is the number of observations in the dataset,
and {LITTLEN...} is the the observation number of an individual observation.
However, the use of {cmd:by}
can change the definitions of {cmd:_N} and {cmd:_n}. Please explain.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}For {GROUP3...} commands like {cmd:generate} and {cmd:list},
using {cmd:by} changes the meanings
of {cmd:_N} and {cmd:_n}.
For these commands,
{cmd:_N} becomes the total number of observations
in the {it:by-group} (not the dataset),
while {cmd:_n} becomes the observation number
within the by-group (not the dataset as a whole).

{pstd}With {view `"{BY-}##group4"':group 4} commands,
including {cmd:egen},
the values of {cmd:_N} and {cmd:_n} are unpredictable.
{cmd:_N} and {cmd:_n} should not be used with these commands.

{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 4}

{hline}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{it}{...} Create a variable named {cmd:sexn} that is the number of respondents
of a given sex. For example, if {cmd:sex = Male}, {cmd:sexn} should equal {cmd:590}.

{pstd}What group(s) are the command(s) you used?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"bysort sex: generate sexn = _N"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{cmd:generate} is {GROUP3...}.

{hline}{marker q5}

{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 5}

{hline}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{it}{...} Create a variable named {cmd:treatment} that is {cmd:1} or {cmd:0}.
Use {cmd:by}, {cmd:_N}, and {cmd:_n}
to ensure that treatment is balanced with respect to {cmd:sex}
by assigning {cmd:treatment = 1} to the first half of males
and the first half of females
and {cmd:treatment = 0} to the second half of males and the second half of females.

{pstd}To check that you got it right:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"bysort sex: tabulate treatment"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{it}{...} Or:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"tabulate sex treatment"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}To create {cmd:treatment}:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"bysort sex: generate treatment = _n <= _N / 2"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Note the use of the logical expression
{cmd:_n <= _N / 2} to create the dummy variable.

{hline}{marker q6}

{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 6}

{hline}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{it}{...} Using the {cmd:by} {it:varlist1} {cmd:(}{it:varlist2}{cmd:)} syntax,
create a variable named {cmd:over30} that is
{cmd:1} if any member of a respondent's {cmd:castename} is older than {cmd:30},
and {cmd:0} otherwise.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}Here is one option, using a logical expression:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"bysort castename (age): generate over30 = age[_N] > 30"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Here is another option,
again using a logical expression, this time to create a dummy variable:

{pstd}{cmd:* "respover30" for "respondent over 30"}{p_end}
{pstd}{bf:{stata `"generate respover30 = age > 30"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{bf:{stata `"bysort castename (respover30): generate over30 = respover30[_N]"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"tabulate over30"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{bf:{stata `"tabulate castename over30"'}}{p_end}
