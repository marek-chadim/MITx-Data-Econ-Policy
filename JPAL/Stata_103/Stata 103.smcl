{pstd}Thanks to Harrison Diamond Pollock, who wrote many of the problem set questions
and helped edit the training.
Thanks also to Niall Keleher, Gean Spektor, and Jeffery McManus
for valuable contributions to the course.

{pstd}This training introduces essential Stata concepts
and shows how to practically apply them to a variety of data tasks.
Completing the training provides the basis for the more advanced data management
and cleaning tasks that are introduced in {bf:Stata 104}. If you have any questions
about this training or have suggestions for improvements, email

{pstd}The training material is written in SMCL (pronounced "smickle"), Stata's output language.
Since multiple SMCL files will be used, your working directory needs to be set correctly using {cmd:cd}.
Now, {bf:{ul:set your working directory to the directory that contains this SMCL file.}}
If you opened this file by double-clicking on it, you probably don't need to change your working directory.
