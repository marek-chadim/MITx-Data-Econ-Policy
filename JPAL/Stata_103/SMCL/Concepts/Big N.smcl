{pstd}{helpb _N} is the number of observations in the dataset:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"display _N"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}To return to that most important of checks {hline 2}
that the unique ID is in fact unique {hline 2}
{cmd:_N} can be used to determine
whether there are duplicate IDs.

{pstd}If there are no duplicates on {cmd:hhid},
then the number of unique values of {cmd:hhid} should equal the number of observations.
{cmd:tabulate} lists all the unique values of a variable:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"tabulate hhid"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}It also stores the {it:number} of unique values as the {helpb return:saved result} {cmd:r(r)}:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"return list"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"display r(r)"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}This is less than the number of observations:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"display _N"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}This means that (as we knew) there are duplicates on {cmd:hhid}.

{pstd}{bf:Note:} For more examples of saved results such as {bf:r(r)}, see {bf:Stata 104}.
