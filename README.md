# MicroMasters Program in Data, Economics, and Design of Policy

- MIT’s Department of Economics and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) designed the MicroMasters® program in Data, Economics, and Design of Policy (DEDP) to equip learners with both practical skills and theoretical knowledge to address pressing global challenges. The core curriculum covers essential topics such as economics, probability and statistics, data analysis, and designing and running randomized evaluations to assess the effectiveness of social programs. Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee, winners of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences and pioneers in development economics, contribute their expertise on methodologies for poverty alleviation. The International Development Track allows learners to apply the tools acquired through the core courses to explore development issues that are most prevalent in low- and middle-income countries experiencing massive and persistent poverty.The Public Policy Track will also require learners to rely on the tools acquired through the core courses, but to address a range of public policies, including both local issues and those that transcend geographic boundaries.
