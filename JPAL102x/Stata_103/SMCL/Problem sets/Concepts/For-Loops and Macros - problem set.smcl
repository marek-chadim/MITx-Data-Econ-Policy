{pstd}Loop over these values of variable {cmd:castename}:
{cmd:"hami"}, {cmd:"jain"}, and {cmd:"rawat"}.
For each of these castes,
{cmd:summarize} the variables {cmd:sex}, {cmd:age}, and {cmd:educ}.

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 103", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Variable {cmd:castecode} is categorical: it can be one of a fixed set of values.

{pstd}{bf:(a)}

{pstd}Create a dummy variable named {cmd:castecode1} for the {cmd:General} caste.
If {cmd:castecode} is {cmd:1} ({cmd:General}), {cmd:castecode1} should equal {cmd:1}.
If {cmd:castecode} is another caste, {cmd:castecode1} should equal {cmd:0}.
If {cmd:castecode} is missing, {cmd:castecode1} should also be missing.

{pstd}Use a for-loop to create a dummy variable for each of the six castes.

{pstd}{bf:Problem Set Question 3}

{hline}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 103", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}For many crimes in the dataset,
there is information about which household members were victims.
For example, household members with these IDs
were victims of cycle theft:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"tabulate cycletheftvictim_1"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{bf:{stata `"tabulate cycletheftvictim_2"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(a)}

{pstd}Create a dummy variable named {cmd:cycletheft1} for whether household member {cmd:1}
was a victim of cycle theft.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(b)}

{pstd}Victim information is available for these crimes:
{cmd:cycletheft robbery theft molestation eveteasing attack extortion assault falsecase othercrime}.
Each crime has two victim variables so that households can list multiple victims.
For example, cycle theft had two victim variables:
{cmd:cycletheftvictim_1} and {cmd:cycletheftvictim_2}.

{pstd}Create a dummy variable named {cmd:anycrime1} for whether household member {cmd:1}
was the victim of any crime.
To do this, loop through all crimes.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(c)}

{pstd}Loop through all crimes.
For each crime, first {cmd:display} the crime.
Then {cmd:tabulate} the two victim variables for the crime.
What is the maximum household member number
among members who were victims?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(d)}

{pstd}Reload the dataset:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 103", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}For each household member with member number {cmd:1} through the maximum
(determined in part {cmd:(c)}),
create a dummy variable for whether the household member
was a victim of any crime.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(e)}

{pstd}Using the dummy variables from part {cmd:(d)},
create a variable named {cmd:nvictims}
that equals the number of unique victims in the household.
For example, if household members {cmd:1} and {cmd:3}
were victims, then {cmd:nvictims} should equal {cmd:2}.
This is the case whether household member {cmd:1} experienced
one crime or 10.

{pstd}Using {cmd:nvictims} and information from a household roster,
we could estimate what fraction of the sample was a victim of any of these crimes.
