{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 1}

{hline}
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{it}{...} {bf:(a)}

{pstd}What is the difference between {cmd:_n} and {cmd:_N}?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{cmd:_n} refers to the observation number,
while {cmd:_N} is a constant
that indicates the total number of observations in the dataset.
Thus, {cmd:_n} ranges from {cmd:1} to {cmd:_N}.

{pstd}{it}{...} {bf:(b)}

{pstd}Do you have to be attentive to the sort order when using {cmd:_n}?
How about {cmd:_N}?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{cmd:_N} is a constant that equals the number of observations,
and it is unaffected by how those observations are sorted.
On the other hand, {cmd:_n} refers to the observation number,
{view `"{SUBSCRIPTING_ANSWERS-}##q1"':which depends on the sort order}.
When using {cmd:_n}, you must be sure that the dataset is sorted as you expect.

{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 2}

{hline}

{pstd}{it}{...} Can you interpret the logical expression {cmd:hhid == hhid[_n - 1]}?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}This tests whether the observation's value of {cmd:hhid} is
equal to the previous observation's value of {cmd:hhid}.
If this condition is true, the expression equals {cmd:1};
if it is false, the result is {cmd:0}.
