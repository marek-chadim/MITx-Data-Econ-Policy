{pstd}What is the {cmd:bysort} command?
How does it differ from {cmd:by}?
When should you use {cmd:bysort}?

{pstd}{bf:Problem Set Question 3}

{hline}

{pstd}We know that without {cmd:by},
{BIGN...} is the number of observations in the dataset,
and {LITTLEN...} is the the observation number of an individual observation.
However, the use of {cmd:by}
can change the definitions of {cmd:_N} and {cmd:_n}. Please explain.

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Create a variable named {cmd:sexn} that is the number of respondents
of a given sex. For example, if {cmd:sex = Male}, {cmd:sexn} should equal {cmd:590}.

{pstd}What group(s) are the command(s) you used?

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 102", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Create a variable named {cmd:treatment} that is {cmd:1} or {cmd:0}.
Use {cmd:by}, {cmd:_N}, and {cmd:_n}
to ensure that treatment is balanced with respect to {cmd:sex}
by assigning {cmd:treatment = 1} to the first half of males
and the first half of females
and {cmd:treatment = 0} to the second half of males and the second half of females.

{pstd}To check that you got it right:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"bysort sex: tabulate treatment"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Or:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"tabulate sex treatment"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Using the {cmd:by} {it:varlist1} {cmd:(}{it:varlist2}{cmd:)} syntax,
create a variable named {cmd:over30} that is
{cmd:1} if any member of a respondent's {cmd:castename} is older than {cmd:30},
and {cmd:0} otherwise.
