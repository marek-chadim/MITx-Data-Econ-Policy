{pstd}{bf:(a)}

{pstd}Use {cmd:duplicates tag} and {cmd:count} to determine the number of {cmd:surveyid} duplicates.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(b)}

{pstd}First, use {cmd:duplicates drop} to drop the exact copy of {cmd:hhid "1807077"}:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"duplicates drop"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Now, using {cmd:duplicates tag} and {cmd:count},
find all numeric variables that uniquely identify observations.
If the output is overwhelming, try adding {cmd:quietly} before select commands.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(c)}

{pstd}Find all combinations of two numeric variables that uniquely identify observations.
Reminder: {cmd:duplicates tag} takes a variable {it:list}.

{pstd}Make sure you have used {cmd:duplicates drop}
to drop the exact copy of {cmd:hhid "1807077"}.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}A (much faster) alternative to {cmd:duplicates tag} is
the combination of {helpb isid} and
{view `""SMCL/Tasks/Logic Checks.smcl"##capture"':{bf:capture}}.
Extra credit if you try using them,
but only do so if you already know {cmd:capture} and {cmd:_rc}.
If you don't know them, we will discuss them
in the module on {view `""SMCL/Tasks/Logic Checks.smcl""':logic checks}.
