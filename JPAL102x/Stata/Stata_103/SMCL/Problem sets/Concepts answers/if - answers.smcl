{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 1}

{hline}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 103", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{it}{...} Which {cmd:if} should be used: the {cmd:if} command or the {cmd:if} qualifier?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{it}{...} {bf:(a)}

{pstd}List the genders of respondents less than {cmd:30}.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{cmd:if} qualifier: the command has been limited to a subset of the data, respondents younger
than {cmd:30}:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"list sex if age < 30"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{it}{...} {bf:(b)}

{pstd}Determine the number of values of {cmd:sex} that are less than {cmd:0}
and save it in a local.
If this number is greater than {cmd:0}, {cmd:summarize sex}.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{cmd:if} command: the command has not been limited to a subset of the data.
Utilizing {helpb return:saved results}, a concept introduced in {bf: Stata 104},
the code for this might look like:

{pstd}{cmd}count if sex < 0{txt}{p_end}
{pstd}{cmd}local n = r(N){txt}{p_end}
{pstd}{cmd}if `n' > 0 {{txt}{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd}summarize sex{txt}{p_end}
{pstd}{cmd}}{txt}{p_end}

{pstd}{it}{...} {bf:(c)}

{pstd}{help tabulate oneway:Tabulate} the occupation frequencies of women.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{cmd:if} qualifier: the command has been limited to a subset of the data, namely women:

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"tabulate occupation if sex == 2"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}{it}{...} {bf:(d)}

{pstd}Determine the number of values of {cmd:sex} that are less than {cmd:0}
and save it in a local.
If this number is greater than {cmd:0},
list the values of {cmd:hhid} for which {cmd:sex} is less than {cmd:0}.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}Both. First the {cmd:if} command is used to test whether there are any values
greater than {cmd:0}, then the {cmd:if} qualifier limits the observations whose values of
{cmd:hhid} are listed to those for which the variable is less than {cmd:0}.
Again utlizing {helpb return:saved results}:

{pstd}{cmd}count if sex < 0{txt}{p_end}
{pstd}{cmd}local n = r(N){txt}{p_end}
{pstd}{cmd}if `n' > 0 {{txt}{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd}list hhid if sex < 0{txt}{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:Answer to Question 2}

{hline}
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{it}{...} {bf:(a)}

{pstd}How can you tell whether a command allows the {cmd:if} qualifier?
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}A command's help file shows whether it allows the {cmd:if} qualifier.
If it does, [{it:{help if}}] will usually appear
on the first line of the syntax section.

{pstd}{it}{...} {bf:(b)}

{pstd}Name a command that allows the {cmd:if} qualifier (besides {cmd:summarize})
and another that does not (other than {cmd:display}).
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}Many commands with which we are familiar allow the {cmd:if} qualifer,
including {helpb tabulate oneway:tabulate}, {helpb generate}, and {helpb browse}.

{pstd}Commands that don't allow the {cmd:if} qualifier include
{helpb describe}, {helpb sort}, {helpb label}, and {helpb local}.
