{pstd}Using explicit subscripting,
write a for-loop that displays the fifth and sixth values of the following variables:
{cmd:age}, {bf:educ}, and {bf:castename}.
Ensure that the data is sorted by {bf:hhid} beforehand.

{pstd}Use the {cmd:browse} command to check your answer.

{pstd}If you need a refresher on for-loops, visit the module on
{view `""SMCL/Concepts/Loops.smcl""':for-loops and macros}.
