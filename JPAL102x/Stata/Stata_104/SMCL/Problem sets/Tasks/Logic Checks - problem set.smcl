{pstd}{bf:Problem Set Question 1}

{hline}

{pstd}In your project, what critical skip patterns could you check using Stata?

{pstd}What command(s) would you use to check this skip pattern?

{pstd}{bf:Problem Set Question 2}

{pstd}How does the output of {cmd:assert} compare with that of
{helpb isid}?

{pstd}{bf:Problem Set Question 3}

{hline}

{pstd}If you add the prefix {cmd:capture} to a command
and the command results in an error,
what do you expect to see?
How about if the command does not result in an error?

{pstd}{bf:Problem Set Question 4}

{hline}

{pstd}It can be difficult to tell whether your {cmd:assert}ions are true
when you use the {cmd:capture} prefix.
What are two solutions to this problem?

{pstd}{bf:(b)}

{pstd}Checking for logical consistency between questions
entails checking that the responses to the different questions
are logically consistent with each other.

{pstd}Skip patterns are an example of a logical relationship,
and you check logical consistency in the same way as skip patterns.
With that in mind, complete the following logic check using {cmd:assert}:

{pstd}Victim 1 of a two-wheeler theft ({cmd:own2wheelertheftvictim_1}) is
different from victim 2 ({cmd:own2wheelertheftvictim_2}).
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(c)}

{pstd}Use {cmd:assert} to check all logicial relationships between {cmd:own2wheelertheft},
{cmd:own2wheelertheftnum}, {cmd:own2wheelertheftvictim_1}, and {cmd:own2wheelertheftvictim_2}:

{pstd}{bf:Problem Set Question 7}

{hline}

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Stata 104", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}In this dataset, there are multiple pairs of variables that first ask
whether a given action has taken place,
and second, how many times it has happened.
These variables have the suffixes {cmd:yn} and {cmd:num}, respectively.
For instance, {cmd:attackyn} and {cmd:attacknum} are one such pair.

{pstd}{bf:{stata `"describe attackyn attacknum"'}}{p_end}
{pstd}{bf:{stata `"browse attackyn attacknum"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Check for logical consistency in all such pairs:
if the yes/no variable is yes,
then the {cmd:num} variable should not be missing;
if the yes/no variable is no,
then the {cmd:num} variable should be missing.

{pstd}{bf:Hint 1:}
First use {cmd:ds} to identify all variables that end with {cmd:yn}.
Do all these variables have the same value label?
Do they all have a corresponding {cmd:num} variable?

{pstd}{bf:Hint 2:}
You may need to use a {help string function}, such as {helpb substr()}.
